# Hospital Database Management System
This repository contains an in-depth report and SQL code for the database management project for the creation of a Hospital DBMS

# Description 
In this project we proposed to create a relational database that efficiently, securely and
succinctly processes medical information. The system would be able to digitally store patient
medical records, appointment schedules, medical staff directories, room assignments and billing
information. This approach would be less time consuming and more secure than a file processing
system which affords the user a much better experience. Automating the process would also
improve healthcare management and staff/patient interactions as greater precision would be
conducted in regards to planning. The patient would be able to plan their appointments, view
their billing statements and access their medical records on one secure platform ahead of time.
The beauty in this approach is that by minimizing logistical congestion in the hospital, you can
optimize the time spent being treated and cared for by medical personnel. Our system would also
allow doctors to quickly retrieve/update medical notes which can ensure that the best diagnostic
practices are being put to use.
